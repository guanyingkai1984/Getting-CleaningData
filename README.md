Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


The following are the code to gather the data

```
## Download the ZIP and UnZIP
filename <- "Files.zip"

# Checking if ZIP already exists, if not download
if (!file.exists(filename)){
  fileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
  download.file(fileURL, filename, method="curl")
}  

# Checking if folder exists, if not unzip
if (!file.exists("UCI HAR Dataset")) { 
  unzip(filename) 
}

## Assigning all data frames
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col.names = c("n","functions"))
activities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("code", "activity"))
subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject")
x_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col.names = features$functions)
y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", col.names = "code")
subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject")
x_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col.names = features$functions)
y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", col.names = "code")
